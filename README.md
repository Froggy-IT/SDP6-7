The Hero Battle Game is a console-based Java project that demonstrates four design patterns: Strategy, Observer, Factory, and Template. 
Different heroes (Warrior, Mage, Archer) fight using attack types like melee, ranged, and magic. 
The Strategy Pattern allows heroes to switch attacks dynamically. The Observer Pattern lets classes like LoggerObserver display real-time battle updates. 
The Factory Pattern creates heroes based on user input through HeroFactory, and the Template Pattern defines shared behavior in the abstract Hero class. 
During the game, heroes attack, change strategies, and notify observers about actions and health changes. 
The project shows how multiple patterns can work together in a clean, flexible design.
